# 托德-《吸引力解锁》：21-资格

Qualification，Right，Getting the girl to tell you why she's cool，Or why you should be with her。

Well number one，We talk about commitment and consistency，Right，Getting her to qualify。

Definitely plays into that，And also getting her to qualify says，I'm a high value guy。

I'm selective etc etc，So very very powerful，And that's why it works，Okay，Also understand this。

By knowing why these things work，It helps you to know when to do them，Okay，If you understand。

The reason you're doing them，It helps you to use them at the right places，Right，So for example，If。

If you're already way too high value，You wouldn't use disqualifiers。

Because if you understand what the disqualifiers do。

You'd know that that's counterproductive in that case，Okay，So understanding the why，Matters a lot。

I see a lot of guys they go out and like，Like，Oh I saw Max do this，I saw Julian do this。

I saw you do this，And they mindlessly repeat these lines，Completely out of context，Right。

Understanding the why helps you contextualize it，And do it in the right place。
