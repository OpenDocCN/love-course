I told you before I laid my eyes，I laid my eyes on you，La mortature I just can't take my eyes。

Can't take my eyes off you，This is Julian and welcome to mission number five。

Now before we crack into this one here，A few things first， okay，Number one。

 this is usually around the time，That people start falling off。

In terms of going out and following the missions，You know， if you scroll through the Facebook group。

There are a lot of mission one posts，There are a lot of mission two posts，Mission three。

 a little bit less，And mission four， even less，Okay， so if this is you，If you identify with this。

You're like， oh， fuck yeah，Kind of stagnated，I kind of gave up on the missions。

First thing you want to do is watch the accountability，Teleconference，Okay。

 I uploaded the replay here below，So scroll down and watch that。

And do whatever you can to just jump back out there，To get your ass out in the field，And number two。

 remember that these missions，Like they're not meant for you to achieve perfection，Okay。

 they're just meant to give you，A better sense of direction，Don't aim for perfection。

Just focus on the direction，So you're not just dabbling while out，Okay， if you go out， for example。

Say seven days a week，Say you miss a day，It's not the end of the world，You know。

 I see a lot of posts where，You know， guys are just kind of，Beating themselves up。

This is not what the missions are designed to be，Okay， this is not another reason for you to。

Beat yourself up and disapprove of yourself，It's just to give you some direction while out，Okay。

 so remember，Number one， it's like really value the fun，Above all else。

If the missions are killing that fun，Go back and you know，Let go of the missions temporarily。

Or don't aim for so much like perfection，Until you kind of get that fun vibe back。

And then add the missions on top of that，Okay， because if you're going out。

And you're not having a blast，Yeah， you're doing your seven days a week，Yeah。

 you're doing the assignments，But you're missing the whole point that is game，Okay。

 so that's the first thing，And the second is last week，Mission number four， I asked you to post。

Some screen caps of different text exchanges，Okay， in terms of setting up a date。

And I thought we could crack into three of them here，The first one， okay。

And this brings up some interesting points，The first one starts like this， okay。

So you got her number，And you text her your name，This is at 3。07 a。m。，At 3。39。

 she texts you back a wink，Okay， and then there's pretty much nothing，Till the next day。

If she texts you back a wink at 3。39，Unless you committed to another girl。

Unless you went home with another girl，Unless you had to go home early。

That's a lead you want to be fucking calling，Like that's one of those numbers。

At the end of the night，So hey， where are you at？，Let's hang out，Let's go for after I was through。

Let's go for a fucking drink，Hey， what's going on？，Versus，Oh， I'll just let it slide，Okay。

 what I usually do is again，I'll text them my name，Around halfway through the night。

I'll be texting them where are you，And yeah， don't let a lead like that die，Okay， so the next day。

You still text her， which is good，You're like hello，Are we still hanging out today？，Her answer is no。

 I can't，It's like hi， I can't，Next question is hey， so when are you free？。

Be careful with this one here，Like these open-handed，Like when are you free？。

That will rarely go somewhere，You want to be decisive，And precise with your text，It's like hey。

 let's do this，At this time， this day，Versus so when are you free？，You know，Then，You wait a bit。

And then you text her like I hate you，Like immediately it's like I hate you。

It's like extremely reactive，Communicating and care way too much，She's still engaged though。

Her answer is，She's like why， winky face，And then，Your answer is well，Because your hair is too dark。

You eat too little meat，And you need 8 days 16 hours and 29 minutes，To respond to a message。

Don't they seem like sufficient reasons，Now again，The whole texting like keeps on going。

It doesn't kill it，But immediately that's like，It's just like extremely try hard off the bat。

The fact that you're counting the days and hours，And minutes is it's just such a big deal。

You remember it's like，The frame of mind when texting is like。

How would you text if you were in the middle of an orgy，With 10 models。

Would you be like oh it was 8 minutes，You wouldn't care，It'd be like way more casual。

Okay for a girl it's not a big deal，If you make it into a big deal。

It seems like you know one your lower value，And number two，It puts a lot of pressure on her too。

To kind of live up to the date，Because it's like so important for you，So more casual。

Also don't expect a girl to be free，The first time you suggest hanging out，You know especially here。

It's like you text her out one，She was out till，You know like 340 here。

So probably till like 4 or 5 a。m。，You're like hey we still hanging out。

She's probably tired as fuck at that time，She answers hey I can't，Okay so something to keep in mind。

Then you keep texting here，There's some back and forth，You text her some pictures。

You text some videos back and forth，She's still engaged which is good。

It's kind of showing your personality，But the you don't want to fall into like。

That frame where you're like，Now her little texting buddy。

You know it's like kind of going back and forth，Guys will do this where，Again you start texting。

And now you're friends over text，But you never hang out in person。

Because you don't want to ruin that，Texting buddy vibe，Like what if it's awkward。

If we meet in person，And it just doesn't really move it forward，So yeah you know。

It's like you're still texting her，It's like hey what are you doing，Tomorrow night that's good。

Hey let's drinks tomorrow，You know maybe try like，I'd say calling her first of all。

Like versus these little videos，Back and forth，And you know maybe try something else。

Then you know let's hang out，Or let's drinks like，Have like a more precise plan。

So don't switch it up a bit，Don't just repeat it over and over，You know it's like hey。

I'm doing this you should come，Hey what about this，Or hey I'm in the area，Like make it easy on her。

That's another one too，It's like for the date，Make it easy，You have her logistics。

You know what area she lives in，Be like hey I'm in this place，What are you doing，You know call her。

Now it's not like，Oh there's this big deal，There's this huge date。

It's probably just stuff to walk out，And you set up a bar nearby，Or doing something nearby。

So that's the first one，The second one，This is a short one，The first text is。

Are you and your bike busy tonight，So most likely call back to，Humor in the text。

You know that's good，It's like again there's a purpose，It's like hey are you busy tonight。

Her answer she's like haha only me，I have your rehearsal till 11pm。

Your text immediately after that is，Hey we'll come have tea at my place after。

So it's like the first text，Like at 11pm it's like，Hey come and have tea at my place。

You know pretty much be a slut for me，So again you're asking for so much compliance。

Or putting her on the spot，Making her seem like a slut，There's no way she's gonna be like。

Sure let's go for tea at 11pm，At your place directly at your place，So obviously there's no answer。

And then you text again，Oh sorry I have to withdraw the offer，I'm too tired extremely reactive。

So again be aware of like，You know how much compliance，You're asking for，It's like make it easy。

And don't make her feel like a fucking slut，The third one，And this is the last one。

We'll kind of go through，You know it's like，Hey get home well，We'll go for ice cream one time。

I promise，That's the text，You know that's fine，It's like you can text her actually。

And at least has your name now，And then you send her like some picture，Of you like singing at church。

And then talking about choir，And with this one it's just like，Man it's like these ideas for dates。

Like the date you suggest，Like hey would you like to go swimming，Tomorrow afternoon at LaBelle。

It's like you know make it like it's，You really have to view the date，First of all is like。

Is this moving it closer，Is it plain to win or not，Like going to fucking swim at LaBelle。

It's like a cool activity，But like is it really moving it towards sex，Not really，You know it's like。

The best date to location，The best date location，Is a little side note。

Is like the shitty bar next to，Like the closest bar to your bed，That's the best location。

And make it easy，Again it's like，Here you're over hyping，It's like it's this big deal。

Like she's like，Well I'm going to go with this guy，I just meant to go fucking swimming。

So I need to prepare my swimsuit，I need to do this，I need to go out。

It's like you're just asking for a lot，It turns the date into this big deal。

It's like oh we need to go swimming now，Versus we're just hanging out。

I would keep yours a little bit more，Casual you know，So this would be the opposite of say。

The first one is just like too casual，Like what are you doing tomorrow，What are you doing for you。

You're kind of on the opposite side of the spectrum。

Okay so these are some lessons to get out of these。

I'd also recommend watching this video on phone game，I'll put a link to it below here。

Now in terms of this mission，Okay mission number five，First thing，Okay we're going to keep it。

At a more relaxed pace here，We're not jumping back to the seven days a week。

We'll probably do like a two week rest period，Last week and this week。

Next week we're going to jump back into seven days，So for this week your mission is。

You have to go out twice，Okay only twice，However for one hour minimum。

And last week it was at night in a bar club，This week it's during the day，Okay so twice this week。

One hour minimum during the day，And the goal here，Okay is to，Get used to these longer interactions。

Okay in order to，Really get consistent results while out，You need to have those。

45 minutes to an hour and a half sets，And if your interaction is just like。

Five ten minutes nothing's going to happen，Now you can practice this while out。

Obviously in a bar club，But during the day，You can kind of ease your way there。

You know it's like there's probably going to be，A lot of girls like sitting out。

You know in fucking summertime，Like sitting out on a，You know at a little restaurant。

On a patio at a coffee shop，And it's easy to kind of，Just sit down and start chatting。

Or if you meet a girl who's walking，Who's not really doing anything，Just insta date her。

It's like let's go for fucking coffee，And now you're sitting there，And now you have a good like。

Oh 20 30 minute chunk，Or longer ideally，Where you can spend time and get used to these。

You can build that endurance and set，So your goal here is to focus on longer sets。

Then of course that'll translate while out，To those 45 minute hour and a half in a bar club。

But the minimum here is try to get，A 20 minute interaction minimum。

OK so let's go out twice for one hour，Each time minimum ideally longer。

And get one set that's at least 20 minutes，OK I resist leaving resist ejecting。

Like get that 20 minutes set，Build that endurance，No matter what，OK the other thing I want you to do。

Is to post your biggest lesson，Slasher epiphany from reading，The way of the superior man。

What really resonated with you，What you got out of it，And the last thing。

And this to make it a little bit fun，I want you to do three，Quote unquote awkward。

Slasher social pressure，Starbucks or coffee shop opens，Where you're basically going to go into。

A Starbucks or any coffee shop，It doesn't matter，Doesn't have to be Starbucks。

It's like kind of that scary situation，We all think of when it comes during the day。

Like oh if I open a girl in line，Everyone's going to fucking hear，That's what I want you to do。

So you're going to go into Starbucks，One of those kind of hectic crazy situations。

And I want you to open a girl in line，Or a girl seated at a table，Loud so people can fucking hear。

OK I want that social pressure，When you get used to it，And your opener is，Excuse me did it hurt。

You wait for answers，She'll probably be like what，Everyone's going to be like what the fuck。

What's this guy talking about，And then you continue，When you fell out of heaven。

Or when you fell from heaven，That's your open，Like the cheesiest fucking pickup line，Like excuse me。

Did it hurt，When you fell from heaven，And I want you to say it loud enough。

So everyone's like what the fuck，I want people to kind of laugh，People will be like what the fuck。

This guy just opened with the cheesiest line，Ideally you should laugh at it too。

And this will one get you again，Desensitize to these like more，Scary situations。

Learn to have fun in them，And to get used to that social pressure，OK so that's the mission。

Two days this week，OK an hour minimum，Each time during the day，Number two focus on a long set。

You need a 20 minute set minimum，Number three post your biggest lesson。

Or epiphany from the way of the superior man，And number four do three awkward，Starbucks opens。

Good luck。
