# 朱利安tengame：4.任务---更多课程微信156066050：任务9

I told you before I laid my eyes，I laid my eyes on you，L'amour de je，I just can't take my eyes。

Can't take my eyes off you，This is Julian and welcome to mission number nine。，Okay。

 now with this mission here， you can slow it down。。

You don't have to go out for the next seven days straight。，You can recuperate， relax a bit。

 recenter yourself。，And you only have to go out once。，Okay， that's it。，For this week。

 you only have to go out once。，However， that one time that you do go out，。

I want you to surrender to the night。，Okay， so what does this mean？，You're gonna go out Thursday。

 Friday or Saturday。，Okay， one of those busier nights。，And instead of just， you know。

 going for an hour，or maybe just going out and， you know，，when the bar closes or the club closes，。

you're a little tired。，You're like， oh， you know， I did well tonight。，I'm gonna go home。。

And there may be those opportunities，，but you just don't feel like it。，I see this all the time。。

Someone will go out。，It's the end of the night。，There's a girl and they're like，，Well。

 do I really wanna spend another hour out？，I don't even know if something's gonna happen。，Plus。

 she lives like an hour away。，It doesn't really seem like a sure thing。，Oh， and I'm tired。，Oh。

 I have to wake up tomorrow。，All those excuses pop in。，And you just， again，。

leave all these opportunities on the table。，It happens all the time。，So for this one night，。

you're gonna go out，pretty much for the entire night。，Okay， I don't care if those excuses pop in。。

You're out and you're surrendering to the night。，And you're putting yourself in。

the situations where something could happen。，Okay， so if you live in an area where，，you know。

 the bars， clubs close at 2 a。m。，，the rule is you're out till 4 a。m。，，no matter what， okay？，Unless。

 obviously，，you pull and make something happen before。，But if not， you are out until 4 a。m。 minimum。。

I don't give a fuck if you're tired。，I don't give a fuck what your excuse is。，4 a。m。，Okay。

 so you really don't have a choice。，You're out and say the club's closing at 2，。

and there's all those girls。，Instead of being，，I'm just gonna go home，，you have two more hours。。

Unless you pull， you have two more hours out。，Okay， if she lives an hour away，，go with her，。

because you have two more hours out。，If you live in an area where the clubs close，at say 4 or 5 a。m。。

，you're out till 6 a。m。，Okay， so you're either out till 4 a。m。，or you're out till 6 a。m。。

no matter what， for that one night。，Okay， and it's really surrendering to the night。，And again。

 being open to whatever could happen。，Okay， it's not this little one-hour session。。

It's not you going home。，At the end of the night，，it's you staying out all night。，You will see，。

doing this exercise，，pulling will be a very realistic possibility。，You're gonna want to pull，。

because you don't want to stay out in the street，for another two hours。，And all those little excuses。

that you usually have will just disappear。，Okay， so I want that one night， surrendering to the night。

，I want you to post a report，in the Facebook group。，And the goal is make it epic。。

It's either an epic pull or it's an epic，，you know， a few hours of you just hustling。

and trying to make it happen。，But I want an epic fucking story，posted in the Facebook group。。

That's the big one for this week here。，Okay， I also want you to read a book。。

The book is Letting Go by David Hawkins。，That's your reading material for this week。。

This goes hand in hand with the，Diving into your subconscious bonus webinar。

as well as the letting go video，that was posted below。，So if you haven't seen that one，。

click in the menu。，Okay， scroll down to diving into your subconscious。。

Read the book Letting Go by David Hawkins。，This in my opinion goes far beyond。

just success with women。，Probably the most life changing book，that I've ever read。。

Highly recommend it。，That's your reading material for this week。，Since you're only going out once。。

And I also want you to write a report。，Okay， zoom out， take some perspective。

and write a report on your progress so far。，Okay， from let's just say even the start of you。

getting into 10 game， the past eight weeks。，What were the major takeaways，or some of the highlights。

or some of the challenges。，Zoom out， write a report，，give yourself props。。

And the last thing here to make it a little bit fun。，I want you to go out in crowded area。。

I'll say during the day outside in the street。，Maybe a crosswalk or something。

where a lot of people are walking。，I want you to stand as if you know。

in a star position with your legs out straight，，your arms out straight like full on star。。

And with that position，，I want you to yell out for one minute，your report， your big takeaways。，Okay。

 from the past eight weeks，of applying 10 game。，Embracing that social pressure there。，So to recap。

 this week you only have to go out once。，Over that one time you're surrendering to the night。。

If you live in an area where，the venues close at two， you're out till four。。

If you live in an area where they close later，，you're out till six。。

And I want you to write an epic report，in the Facebook group。，Number two。

 I want you to read the book，Letting Go by David Hawkins。，Number three， I want you to zoom out。

and reflect on the past eight weeks，of applying 10 game。，What were the big takeaways？。

What did you learn？，And number four， I want you to go out，in a public area， stand。

as a starfish pretty much，and yell out for one minute straight。，Those takeaways， those lessons。。

Embrace the social pressure。，And good luck。。
