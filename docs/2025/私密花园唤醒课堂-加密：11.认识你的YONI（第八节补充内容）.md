About knowing about our ear。Why is there shame about knowing about our genitals， This is my body。

What is coming up for you as you look at yourself， as you see your vulva？I didn't realize。

What color she was。 Tell me about her gorgeous color palette。 Like her。

 her colors go from light brown and then kind of more into pink。How's it for you， Chandra？

I've never been this up close and personal， what does she need to hear， relax？Som so intention。

 beautiful， impact， we're going to separate those two things。

 like your intention is like I want to be more relaxed， but the impact of saying relax。

Think about that， though， just10 to ten out。那个没有。She's been through it。I don't know。 It's a lot。

 I'm ready to learn， though。 I'd like to offer the suggestion of like。

 I'm committed to learning what you need in order to feel safe enough to relax。

 Like that might be the dialogue。 You want to try that one out。 Your version。

 I'm committed to learn more about you。😊，And in order to relax and be more intuitive with myself。
