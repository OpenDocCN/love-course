# 2.04.02 - Attraction Killers_ev

Alli， what's up man， so you're about to learn the two biggest killers of attraction。

Towards woman and subtle ways that you communicate this to a girl， because obviously， you know。

 super needy things that you can do to a girl or things that will kill attraction。

 You know that you shouldn't be overly creepy。 but there's also subtle little ways that girls pick up on immediately that you're not even aware that you're doing。

 So if you can eradicate all that， you'll never kill the attraction because it sucks。 man。

 when you actually get a girl on a date or having an amazing conversation with her。

 and you say or do something。 And then you could see it in her eyes， just all attraction is lost。

 So let's get into it。So the two things that will leave you on red every time or have a go ghosting on you。

 or she'll say yes to a date and then completely just never talk to you again or even on the date。

 have that awkward silence and you know your heart sinking that you're just losing all chance of getting with her。

Man。The two things are your neediness and insecurity。 Now， this may not be a surprise to you。

 but what is a surprise is the subtle things you do that lead to that that you probably had no idea about behind the surface of every insecure and needy act is this bottom core thing that this idea that the woman is gonna make you happy that you want validation that she's this high value girl。

 And you see her as above you。 and therefore， you're doing things to try to subtly get up to her level or take her down to yours。

 So let me tell you a quick story about a girl that also camet with the college Now。

 She was the best sex I've ever had up until that point in my life。 I mean。

 we literally one time we were going home on the bars。

 And like we had sex on the lawn of this house and people are going by watching us。 It was。

Super freaky So I was pretty obsessed with her right， And she was pretty addictive。

 And so I put her really high value， and she would only text me at like she would ignore me the whole entire week and then send me a random text message on like Saturday night saying I'm here and I would like rush across town to go meet her at the bar。

 pretend that I was like on my way there already。 And man。

 So I remember I was dancing with her on the dance floor when。

 this is like the fourth timer hanging out。 And we I'm just dancing with her。

 and I pick her up and I spin her around randomly because I thought it was just something to do。

 but it was coming from a place of like I have to do this。 I have to try。 And when I put her down。

 she just looks at me and all attraction and her I just died。 You could just tell she was just like。

😊，Why are you trying so hard。And my heart was like， oh， you know。

 like she completely just lost all attraction for me because。

I was subtly trying to just gain her approval because I didn't think I was enough the way I was。 Now。

 let's go over 15 quick ways that you are subtly doing this so you can avoid all of them in the future and never kill attraction once you've already built it up。

 So the first way guys are overly needy or inecure is by doing interview mode， right。

 giving super logical and asking a girl a million questions。

 the more questions you ask the more they're just like， I'm here from here。

 give me the short little answers and it's boring to them And it shows that you're it's subcommunics to the girl。

 that you're just needing her to stick around like give me an answer， contribute to the conversation。

 Give me， give me give me right which is the basis of all insecurity。

 The second thing we already talked about is putting the moment up on a pedestal。

 having the belief and this comes from a feeling， right， that she is above you。😊，Right。

 that she is somehow better than you。 that she's has something that you don't that you need her。

 right Like you need in order to get to this place of happiness， this realm。

 a possibility that she is gonna unlock that for you。

 And when you have the illusion that a girl has this more value than you do or that she's unattainable or she only goes for guys that are better than you。

 you'll never get her。 man， the third one is asking a girl if she's okay。

 or there's that silent moment and you're saying to her， Hes everything all right。

 girls hate that right， because it assumes that something isn't that you need to make the moment better。

 It shows that you're in your head and that you have to like try harder。

 Another example of this is just saying going to a restaurant and you say， hey。

 do you want to go here， she says yes， and you're like， are you sure， I mean， is that what you like。

Even me saying that just like cring。 So recognize that， look， as a guy， you decide what you want。

 you want to go where you want。 And if she doesn't want to like that。

 then that's her decision as a woman to speak up as an adult。

 The fourth one is when you say a joke or a funny story and you're looking for that response。

 right instead of just telling a joke because you think it's funny and you like the joke。

 You're looking for that response。 And she can tell people can tell in general when you're telling a story。

 You have that group of people in a room and one person is telling a joke or a story and then people start slowly kind of looking away。

 And the persons like lock on for someone paying attention。 And there's always that one guy。

 maybe it's you that's just like looking at him like， yeah， man， I'm listening to you。

 right that guy that's telling the story。😊，He's searching for attention and validation。

 If you just tell a story， we're going to teach this later on。

 but if you just tell a story or're a joke from a place of like， I find this funny。

 it's self amusing。There's no neediness attached to it。

 And you get more of the positive outcome you want。

 Number 5 is giving her too many compliments all the time。

 Like there is a subtle way to give a girl compliments in a push pull kind of method。

 but simply compliment your left and right like， oh， I love the way your hair looks。 Oh。

 that's a really cool job。 Oh man， you're really funny。 Like all these things on and on and on。

 It's like that overly nice guy。 And it's just， it makes a girl think that you have  altereri your motives。

 This is the one that I think most guys struggle with。

 That's a subtle sign is you're constantly checking your phone to see if she text you back。😊。

Now you may think that she doesn't know this。Man， there's something in the ether of text messaging where I think a girl can just tell that like。

 you're like waiting that she's like。You're waiting for her texture back。 She just knows， right。

 She really does。 I when you're constantly checking on your phone。

 you're not on your purpose in life。 You're not super busy。

She's gonna sense that When you go to touch her， it is awkward， right。

 So we're gonna go into kinesthetic touching later on and I have a girl example of this with us。

 But that awkward touch like， okay， now time to put my arm around her and you're all stiff and's just not comfortable or you're touching her more than you should or it's just like a very meek touch。

 And she's just like， what was that。 If you're gonna to touch a girl I'm gonna to teach you how to do it smoothly And in a very comfortable way。

 This is a subtle one talking negatively， overly negatively about girls you've been with in the past。

😊，Look when you talked negatively about a girl in the past。

 It shows that you actually have a lower self-esteeem。 and she may think to herself， man。

 like if this guy and me of breakup or stop seeing each other Will we talk badly about me。

 It's like being in the job interview， you never talk badly about the last company。

 no matter how bad your experience was with them， you always talk positively because it shows you have higher self-esteeem higher self worth。

 commenting and liing all her social media posts and even following and watching all her stories all the time。

Just stop because this creates a celebrity effect in the girl that when you finally see the grown in person。

 it's like she's putting her on the pedestal。 right， So stop commenting on your social media posts。

 E changing your moods back and forth， letting her affect the way you feel。

 You should feel how you feel and nothing should really perturb that that much， especially the woman。

 Like if the girl says something that she's upset with。 Or she says a joke that's not that funny。

 You shouldn't change your mood for her。 It shows low status。し。Fishing for compliments。 Look。

 never fish for a compliment， right， No your own worth。 Just don't do it。

 Ting her back immediately and texting her all day。 Look。

 there's something to be said about letting the girl chase you。

 If you've been texting her back and forth。 And even if you really like her。 and you。

 you want to hang out with her again， your， you're so stoked on it。

 You're thinking about her all day。If a girl leaves you because he didn't text her for a whole day。

She should never be in the first place， okay？So stop texting herself frequently。

 You move way too fast into the wanting to get into a relationship phase or having the relationship talk or asking if she's monogamous。

 trying to move forward too fast。 I'll teach you guys how to do this， but。

It should be minimum like five days before you have any idea of a conversation about monogamy。

 You sacrifice your work or hanging out with other friends in order to hang out with her。 So。

 for example， she says， hey， I can only hang out on Thursday。 And then you said yeah， cool me too。

 And then she changes oh， sorry just Friday。 And then you're like oh。

 and you already said you have plans on Friday。 You're like， oh， you change your plans like oh， no。

 something freed up。 do not do that。 do not change your schedule for her。

 So these are all ways that you can kill attraction and confidence in being 80 And ultimately we're gonna get into really how to。

😊，Defeated at the core， right to eradicate all neediness。

 But I wanted to show you these subtle signs that you're probably doing。

 So your homework for this week is to share these subtle signs that you're probably done throughout the week and say and commit to yourself that you're not gonna do them anymore。

 Okay， I'll see you in the next one。
