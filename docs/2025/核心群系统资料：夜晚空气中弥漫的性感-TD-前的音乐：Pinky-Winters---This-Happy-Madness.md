# 核心群系统资料：夜晚空气中弥漫的性感 TD 前的音乐：Pinky Winters - This Happy Madness

🎼。What should I call this happy madness？That I feel inside of me。Some kind of wild October gladness。

That I never thought I'd see。What has become of all my sadness， all my endless lonely sighs。

🎼Where are my son。🎼now。🎼What happened to the frown？And is that self contented clown。

Standing there grinning。🎼The mirror。🎼Really， me。🎼。I'd like to run through Central Park。

Carve your initials in the bark。Of every tree I pass for everyone to see。

I feel that I've gone back to Ch。🎼And I'm skipping through the wild wood。 So excited。

🎼That I don't know what to do。What do I care if I'm a Jew？なよ。🎼I smile。 my secret little smile。

Because I know the change in me is you。What should I call this happy madness？All this unexpected joy。

🎼That turn the world。🎼Into a babys bouncing to。🎼He。The gods are laughing far above。

One of them gave a little shove。🎼And I felt gaily， gladly， madly。🎼では。

What should I call this happy madness？All this unexpected joy。🎼Let turn the world。

🎼Into a baby's bouncing toy。🎼The gods are laughing far above。One of them gave a little shove。

And I fell gaily， gladly， madly into love。🎼Yeah。
