# 私密花园唤醒课堂-加密：06.认识你的外Y和Y D（第五节补充内容）

点。Yeah， anatomy wise， I wonder like Damon's always like your clue is really small and I'm like， oh。

 maybe something like maybe it's not big enough， maybe it needs like maybe it needs to come out more。

 I don't know， we don't do before play very often， I don't know how to have orgasms except for like with a vibrator。

His parents are like wondering why he doesn't have any babies and like what is he waiting for and like why am I not giving them basically like am I going to have an orgasm before I have a baby？

Right like who doesn't want to orgasm and I mean， that would be awesome and then maybe I would be like。

Great， let's have sex all the time。Part of my discovery as a somatic sexologist has been what is ironroically possible。

 And so today， we're going to talk about arousal。 arousal and fertility are linked。

 Learn something new， yeah。This is a Volva puppet。I like this one because it has the entire structure of the clitoris。

 there was this story going on about Erica's clitoris being small。😊。

And when anybody says anybody's genitals are small。

 I often just think it's because they're not being aroused。 Size isn't necessarily what matters。

 Arousal is what matters。 I wanted to educate them on， here's her anatomy。

 Here's how to work with her anatomy。 What's interesting about anatomy is that a lot of the vulvabodied anatomy got taken out of the textbooks。

 So if you look at like early 1800s， it's all in there。

 And then we go through kind of the Victorian era， and it disappears。

 They only kept the reproductive organs。 And so we lost a lot of the anatomy。

 And then the way things were named also denote shame。

 Even the nerve that innervates all the external genitalia was called the puendal nerve。

 which pudendal mean shame。 So studying sex and studying the anatomy was shameful。Okay。

 so outer labia， and these can be big or small， all different sizes as someone gets more aroused。

 these start to pop out more。The inter labia start to come out because they're swelling and all of this poofs out more。

 This is the clital hood。 So similar to someone who's penis bodied。

 this would be the foreskin Now clitoriss are sometimes ins or outdiies Like sometimes the clitoris is more in underneath the hood。

 and sometimes it's more out and exposed。 and then we have arousal right。

 which is going to change it， which is going make a little bit more exposure right。

 The clitoris is going to grow It's very similar to someone's penis。

 And there's the shaft of the clitis， which is this whole piece here。

 And this is all erectile tissue that ingrges with blood。

 We've got all this is also the clitoris so we have the clital legs， which are in here。

 they wrap around。 This is the vaginal canal here。 The clal legs here。

 and then the vestibular bulbs or sometimes people call them the clitoral bulbs。

So there's all this internal structure to the clitoris， which wraps around the vaginal canal。

 So I just want to show you the whole clitoris。That's the whole glitteritoris。

It's a lot of tissue dating。Give this part attention。But you've got all this tissue here。

To play with。Wow。Aren't we amazing， Yes， I know I'm thinking right now like geez。

 women just get more awesome awesome。 So these are some of the landmarks today that we're going to find on your body。

 How do you feel now about me taking a look at your anatomy and helping him do some landmarks。 Yeah。

 that sounds great。 great。 Thank you。 Allright。😊。
