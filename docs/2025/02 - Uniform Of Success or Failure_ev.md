# 02 - Uniform Of Success or Failure_ev

Welcome Anne。You have no idea how beyond stoked I am for you for this course。

How much is just going to completely change your life， not just with dating？

With confidence with becoming literally a different person， This is a dating course。

 you are going to get objective results。 You're gonna to improve your dating life。

 You're gonna to become more confident around women know what to say。

 have amazing sexual experiences， create relationships， all of that。

 But I want to share with you two quotes that really encapsulate their journey you're about to embark on。

😊，So my favorite quote of all time is by Zig Zigler， I'm paraphrasing here， but he says。

It's not what you get by achieving your goals， but who you become in the process and this process of mastery。

 of mastering your own。Understanding with women， you're developing so many other skills and values as a man。

And so。I want you to know that。And the second quote is by Claude Bernard。

 which saysIt is what we know already that often prevents us from learning。

And I really want to share that one with you because。Whether you're a beginner， in advance。

 whatever you see yourself， the thing that's going to prevent you the most is a couple things。

 But one of the things that's going to prevent you the most from。

Really getting what you want when you decided to invest in yourself is pretending you already know something。

Come into this with a blank site。 Like if I tell you about。

Girls testing you or what to say body language like， I know the vocal tone， I know this。

Try to suspend that judgment because you're not going to hear things that are super important。

 So try to keep it open in mind。 The second thing about this program is that I put years into really intricately developing these ideas。

 Now， depending on your level where you're at， which we'll go into a little bit later。

It's designed that if you're at a beginner， you'll take on certain things。

 and you can come back and after you go from the beginner to the you know intermediate。

 you can come back again and watch it again and get new insights。

 This is multilayed in what I'm teaching right So if some stuff is going over your head when you come back to it later on。

 you get these new insights， you get to a new level， you'll start to absorb it more。

 So this course is supposed to be rewatched more than once。

 Now a sure way you can add things that we can mess up and。Not progress， not meet your goal is this。

It's to not complete the course。Look， going back to that original quote。

 like the one thing that really， after working with hundreds of men that I found that the guys that go on to change their life。

To go from not being able to look at a woman in the eyes。

 like I was back in college to having three sums talk in the tens， like whatever they want。

 being ultimately confident around every woman they talk to is not taking action。

RightSo that being said， it is vital， necessary 100% you need to complete every video and do every exercise。

 even if you find it tedious， even if part of yourss like I't able to do。

 I I know the result of this。Then just exercises， finish the whole entire course post in the Facebook group。

 attend the live Q&A calls。Take every resource and use it。 I am guaranteeing you， this has been。

All this knowledge is downloaded from years and years and years。

 I know exactly every step that's going to lead you to your goal。 So if you trust me。

 trust the process that so many other men have already gone through， I guarantee you。

 you will get the results you want。 So for action steps for this video。

 what I want you to do is I want you to immediately join the Facebook group if you already haven't。

I want you to make sure you join the live Q& A calls， add me as a friend on Facebook。

 message me if you need to with any questions or Frank as well， one of the other coaches。

 If you don't have a Facebook account， you don't want social media， just make a fake account。

 trust me， this is worth it。 I don't like social media as well but just make a new account only go on there for the groups right There's different softwares that you can download to like avoid the newsfe。

Do all these things as a first step， okay？And I'll see you in the next video。
