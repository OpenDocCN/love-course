# 12.01 - The Detached Man_ev

All right， you ready for this one， man， you've come a long way。A long way。Proud of you， proud of you。

 truly am I'm sure you've changed a lot， Go some really good results。

 challenge yourself who you think you are so。Man， week 12。

This is the esoteric philosophical understanding。Of game and life change and。

So these videos are going to really tap into the。I want you to view like， if you were to see it that。

 you know， game is like， your behaviors you do， the thoughts you have the beliefs you have。

 like that's all part of this little microcosm， this little circle。

 And the thing that's kind of like holding it all together is your philosophy， right now。

 your philosophy and game could also rely to anything in life， right。

 I'm not just teaching by by now you should know， I'm not just teaching you attraction tactics or how to find the one。

 I'm teaching you to become a new person。 Like I've said before。

 is's not what you get by achieving your goals。 It's who you become in the process。

 You're becoming a new guy。 And what I found in。16 years of really self development field and thousands of clients and working with all top coaches around the world。

嗯。What I found is that there are two concepts in particular that you're going to learn in this video in the next one。

That we've kind of explored a little bit already in the modules。

 but they deserve a lot more like their own videos， because when you truly grasp on the。Unconscious。

 competent level in here， this little thing inside your chest。

You become unperturbed to any rejection， you walk through life with ease， you have that silent power。

That's silent power just walking into a venue and you just。

 you're immediately noticed and people just are gravitated toward you， you don't even know why。

 but people just are gravitating toward you， right so。Let's dive into that right now。

So one thing I mentioned before that I want you to really understand is that your true self。

Who you really are is always coming through the other people。That over time。

 you will convey your true and authentic self。Okay。

 so knowing this has a couple of implications when you're talking to that girl。

 when you're talking to a stranger in general or bosser。Anyone in the world right。

 you know if you're a good person right and I bet you that if you're investing into this course and I just know you're a good person。

 okay， I can tell right because like attracts like right so。That being said， man。

 if someone's not giving you the response that you see in yourself， then that's on them， right。

 it's not on you。Right that you recognize that over time， someone may give you this。

 especially a girl， she may give you this RBFA or this holding back or whatever。

 but like you know that you're a good person with good intentions and a lot to offer。

 So therefore your true self will come through over time。

 and that's not on you to try to convince other people to understand that's for you just to know in your heart Now you know that attraction is literally the mechanism of bringing someone closer to you to attract is to bring closer together and to connect is literally and physically connect with a woman to combine the masculine and feminine together into one literally connecting and a part of that is this understanding of giving and taking and there is a fundamental concept in reality。

That of non attachment。In that。The world， the universe， or whatever it is。Whatever you are。

 whatever you want to call it。It is giving you things that you want but don't need。

 and you need to find that healthy balance， and the way to do that is to have this sense of non attachment or indifference to outcome。

That at any point across your life。What this looks like is when you go out to a club or to a party like your goal should not be to I want to attract a girl。

 It should always be to I want to have fun right when you walk up to a girl you're thinking to yourself。

 I want to convey my authentic personality and I don't care what she thinks when you're dating a girl and you're starting to fall in love with her you think at any moment like this girl is great but at the same time if she were to ghost on me tomorrow or leave me for another guy。

That's fine too， it's all part of the journey。And when you have this sense of non attachmentment。

 this indifference。I want you to imagine physically close your eyes。Now， I want you to see。

Walking into a room and seeing a bunch of beautiful people， right。

 a bunch of beautiful women that you want to talk to Now， before yourself。

 what what happens that you have all these invisible strings attached to these girls and you'd want this。

 like this physical like energy string， trying to take like pull energy from them。 Give them value。

 But I want you to imagine just like cutting all those off。😊。

And imagine just like this green energy imminating from you just giving value。

 just giving this positivity that you don't need anything from anyone。

 And when you create a life and you create positive emotions and you have these strong core values in who you are。

 knowing your value from the new beliefs that you've adopted across this whole entire program。

 You recognize that no one can give you something that you don't already have。

 Okay And when you come from this place of no one give you anything。

 there's no one out there that's going give you happiness。

 No one's going to give you this amazing job or this money or this sex or relationship that's going make you happy。

😊，That your happiness does come from within。You can cultivate your own happiness and when you walk through life not needing the approval of anyone。

So I don't give a fuck about you， but I don't care about you， like， oh。

 if I don't need you in my life， no， that's kind of a false indifference， right？

That's like a that's a false insecurity， right， it's like， yeah。

 I don't need you in that but I want you。Like I see you attractive girl， I like to get to know you。

Oh， we don't connect， great， going to the next one。And that it's not about you。

And women will sense this authentic， congruent， just masculine polarity of this like I am who I am。

 and I go for what I want and I don't care if you but that or not， there's no games involved。

You see how this works。 This cannot like this cannot be faked， right， You cannot fake this。

 The way to authentically have it happen is with fun right to put the lens of on the world of having fun。

 Remember that story I told you about my friend Tyler， we were in Thailand。

 And there's that moment where we paid for this freaking canoe trip and we't not even moving right for like in the rocks。

But he found fun in it。 It's no wonder that he's super attractive to other girls。 like he's not。

 he's 5，6， not that tall， but he was getting。 She gets so much freaking。😊，Poon， dude。

 like he gets so much gross because whenever he walks into a room， he's just like。

 how can I have fun？Right， and when you walk into a room and you're thinking， like。

 how can I create a positive， How can I make a memory out this， How can I make my life into a movie。

 How can I have a great story about this moment that you can find the little stories in every moment。

 This is where true not attachment comes from。 It comes to recognizing knowing who give you what you want。

 and how can I have fun in every single moment， right。😊，Life is fun。 Life is this giant play。

 this giant game to be played， because ultimately at the end of the day， you're going to die。

 You're going to rotten the earth。😊，Right。You were going to fade away。

 nothing you build in this life the relationships， right。

 even the things that you create the books or the movies or the plays or whatever you create the outlast of your life。

 it is eventually going to fade away into nothingness。

When you have this optimistic nihism it what of basically means like knowing that nothing matters。

 So instead of having this like oh what's the point you have like I'm gonna have as much fun。

 I'm gonna give to others as much as possible。 This is the philosophy。

 one of the main key philosophies to have around anything in life。

 this isn't just with women when you have this philosophy with money when you have this philosophy just towards life and general。

 you attract the highest quality people in your life。

 you attract the best business like when you use this with a law of attraction。

 the high vibrational state we talked about Dr。 Hawkins。

 the model of being in this acceptance of this love and this joyous state you attract a whole new life。

 you become a whole new person。the Stoics， Zen Buddus。

 like all these ancient philosophical teachings teach the same things to not attach to visualize negatively in your mind what you can lose and have gratitude for what you have。

Okay， think of the social freedom this creates for you。To walk into any place and just be like， yo。

 like， what's up， who's here， Like walking up to everyone， just like， I'm your friend。 Like。

 how's it going， man。 And like for the few people that are in their head that are not gonna to respond positively。

 they're gonna be shut down。 it's not about you， right， It's about them。 You are a positive。

 happy person。 Like everyone is your friend， right。

 And you're trying to create funny moments and connect and give value to others。

 How can you help others， You're coming from a place of taking a producing in this world。😊。

You are full of value， whether you believe this or not， it's up to you， but。

The woman you're supposed to be with， the life you're supposed to live。

The man you're supposed to become。Once you become that guy， you will get everything you want。Right。

You attract what you are。There is no secret to this， this is not a secret anymore。

It's just simple fact。 You change your thinking， you change your belief systems。

 you change your story， everything I've taught you up to this point。You will change your results。はい。

Don't attach to the like like the less you attach to these things。

 the less you need the woman enough， the less you need the money。RightAnd you just say to yourself。

 oh， it's just， more more zeros in my bank account。 that allows me to do a bit more things。 Oh， yeah。

 it's like I' I' I'm in a car with a wheel and this time I'm in a car with a little bit of nicer wheel like oh my house is there's a little bit more square footage in my house like。

 oh， the woman is's in my bed naked under me。 she's just a little bit more proportionate。😊，Right。

And that at the end of the day。Nothing external will make you happy。 It does come from within。Look。

 everything in your life up until this point， that's happened to you。It's happened for you， right。

 everything that's happened to you in your life has happened for you。

That's the truth it's for you to see those signs， it's for you to recognize these lessons。

 you were at this point listening to this for a reason。

You were becoming the guy you were supposed to be。Now， if you need more additional help around this。

 watch the later modules on how I can help you even further take it to the next step。 But until then。

 look at the checklist and I'll see you in the next one。
