# 核心群系统资料：夜晚空气中弥漫的性感 TD 前的音乐：Leonard Cohen - I'm Your Man

If you want a love。🎼I'll do anything you。🎼May too。And if you want another kind of love。

🎼I wear a mask for you。🎼If you want a party。My hand or if you want to strike。🎼down in angle。

🎼Here I stand。🎼Yeah。🎼Im your man。If you want a boxer。I will step。Into the ring for you。

🎼If you want a doctor。🎼Allex。🎼Every inch of you。If you want to drive。🎼Clin。🎼Or if you want to。🎼你。

🎼For a ride。🎼No， you can。🎼I am your没。🎼Are the moons to break。🎼The genes to。

🎼The beast won't go to sleep。I've been running through。

These promises to you that I made and out could not keep。🎼阿波的美。🎼不卡路。🎼哪怕别言了。🎼His knee。

Or I crawl to you baby and I followed your feet。🎼How let your future like the dog。🎼いれな？

🎼Cud your heart and I tear at your sheet， that'd say， please。🎼A your妹。🎼。

And if you gotta sleep old old man。🎼down the road， I will steer for you。🎼And if you want a world。

🎼The street alone。🎼This for you。🎼If you want a father。🎼For your child。

🎼Or really they want to walk with me。🎼TheW the little cross the same。🎼Yeah。🎼And your man。

🎼If you want to love。🎼Ill do。🎼Andthing that。🎼As me to。🎼If you warm up。
