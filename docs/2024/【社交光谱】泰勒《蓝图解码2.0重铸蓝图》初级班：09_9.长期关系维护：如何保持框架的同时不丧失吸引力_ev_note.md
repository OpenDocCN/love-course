🎼我是社交光谱莱特，那么我们继续来图解码2.0之旅。本次这节课泰勒讲了关于长期关系，讲了自己的过去，讲了前女友，讲了自己的情感史，讲了自己失恋的心态，还有无所畏惧的心态。

感觉这是泰勒这么多年沉淀的一个结果，也是让我们了解到一个不一样大师顿悟之后对于一个情感的一个理解。So how do you feel right now？

As far as release and merg into it。Okay？So it's always hilarious for me to watch some aspirational YouTuber or social media influencer or speaker watching public speakers for me is just watching people that are so awkward。

 they don't know what they're doing and they're trying to do it from their control muscle So they're up in front of the crowd like hey guys。

 okay， So I'm expert。 Here's what we're going to learn today。 Oh right， this is gonna be super cool。

 know it's like the funest thing for me to watch。😡。

It's like watching people trying to de or socialize。

 it's just like watching this complete dumpster fire。妈。嗯。

Well the big we want to get really funny when I teach you what you're going to learn about marketing。

 you in the next few days， particularly Saturday， but in the next few days。

 you're gonna to see how most people are marketing and it's just like a face palm it is so bad watching people market particularly social media influencers wholl use PayPal or subscribe to our services like that and they just beg people to go to their subscribe start like or they're Paypal they're like okay guys to keep this going I just need you to give me a donation like really bro。

😡，ははは。A call to action should be yielding major dollars。

 a call to action shouldn't be begging like to keep this going guys， keep the seven going。

 I just need you to set in like 20 bucks a month。And then it's going to be okay。

 That's not a call to action。 That that's like， you know。

 if you're trying to get better at dating and you know。

 you walk up to someone who you're attracted to and you're like， look。Really lonelyly。

 it needs attention。To keep this going， you need to， you know， it's like， come on。

 You're not going to convince anybody with anything that way so。Yeah， so you know。

 so I'll show you how to trigger that desire， to trigger that movement and so on and so forth。

 It also comes down having something great to offer too。

 but I'm going to show you how to present that in a way that's going to be really taking the focus off yourself right when you're begging for a donation Who's it about you you've got to make it about the other person。

😡，When you're in your head， who's it about？😡，You when you're in your body， you're just sharing。

 and that's why people pay more attention， because why would people pay more attention to you freely expressing that you being in your head。

 if you think about it， What's so wrong with you speaking from your head， What's wrong with that.

 It's still the same communication。 Why is it such a big deal。 Why is one energetically compelling.

 and the other， there's sort of a wall that goes up to where you don't want to hear it。

 What's going on there， simpleim。😡，In human existence or in any animal life。

Every single biological entity is in effect， wanting to suck from the other biological entities。

 Look at a fish movie， right like blue Planet， go look at planet Earth。

 What are all the animals doing in the jungle。 They're consistently eating each other。😡。

You know the vegetation is getting energy out of the soil， out of the sun。

 then some animal comes and eats that。There's even animals that want to eat you。 There's， I mean。

 think about this。 There's viruses， little microscopic。

 little viruses and parasites and bacteria that are trying to overtake your body right now and kill you。

😡，You know the main reason we reproduce。 Do you even know。It's because。

Bad little entitiesities learn how to get into our bodies。

 So we need to keep reconstituting ourselves in your kid， your grandkid， your great grandkid。

 and on and on and on so that the little invaders don't learn how to get in your body it's like an arms race。

 It's this continual arms race。😡，That's there's literally microscopic things like on the chair right now that are trying to burrow its way in like into your hand。

 you scratch your nose。 now it's going into
