🎼，🎼，🎼，Hey up it's going from Real social dynamics， welcome to a fine morning in Phoenixix， Arizona。

right outside of Old Town， Scottsdale， where we ran a kickass program last night。

and what I want to talk to you about this morning is the distinction between the logical part of your mind that gets things done.

produces results makes money and fits into society and the fuck up emotional part of your brain that just lets you go wild.

have fun， it's really a lot more primitive。And ultimately it's the part of your mind that attracts women and this is a very。

very pressing topic for guys because what you discover when you're trying to meet girls is that the part of your brain that makes you a better provider that you thought was this amazing。

beautiful part of you is actually fucking you up and the reason it's fucking up your shit is because you think that girls actually care that logically speaking you're a good option well。

I've got news for you。How are you？I need kiss you。You。Have you ever kissed each other？

Let me ask you a question， okay， I'm going gonna to start this off with a pop quiz what do you think is a better way to track women option name Hi there。

my name is Zan， I run an eight figure global business， I'm extremely responsible。

I'm responsible for the livelihoods of over 100 staff。I take my role very seriously。

I went to a top school in my country， I read a lot of books， I have a lot of things that I own。

I live in a great house and I would like to take you out to a nice restaurant and show you the amazing life that I built because I think you're a very beautiful woman okay。

that's option eight。Do you think that girls respond to that now， let's look at option B。

we're in Scottsale， so we'll call it the Hey dance。🎼Okay。🎼And doing。For' coming this way。

All that shit that you did that you thought was important。For women。

it was really important for you and the reason is from a woman's perspective。

everything that you're doing is fucking compensation。

anything law school that you have going for you she has disdain for that and anything that is just fun the implication behind it is that you're a high status guy you don't need all that shit and you're just having a good time and this is why you know the stereotype of like the greasy guy who's trying to impress a girl with this Ferrari and he's like yo girl come and see my Ferrari。

how does the girl interpret that？Well， I'll tell you right now she interprets it as if basically you have no reproductive value。

your low status。And so you went and got this material object because your brain was able to kind of wrap itself around that。

but you weren't actually an attractive guy now the reason why that is is because when you get high status。

something changes in you and this is what it is essentially you start laughing and becoming silly and having fun because your brain gets loaded up with different neurotransmitters when you're fucking winning okay so you know imagine walking into a room where you have very low status and imagine walking into a room where you have very high status。

What's the difference in your behavior in the low status room。

you're sitting there thinking of how to impress people， you're thinking of how to。

Offer more value in order to get on the good side， but when you have high status。

you're not thinking that hard because you're not engaged in the logical part of your brain because you're just happy okay and so really what I want to show you today is how to get out that logical part of your brain which essentially is pure compensation before I even get into this I want to make a couple qualifications first of all。

I think that if you don't make good money， at least enough money that you're very happy with。

you're fuck up I think that if you don't have a good home， a good nest， a good life。You know。

all the things you want in life。You're fucking up。I'm not impressed by that。

that shit doesn't impress me one bit if you don't have those things。

I don't care if you fuck 9 million women， unimpressed if you don't have a life that you love。

But what I'm trying to say to you is that regardless of the fact that these things are important。

They are not game okay， they're not game they're simply important to you are you learning more tonight Okay。

so what you going what are you going to carry with you
