## 乐趣的重要性

WeHave no doubt the currency of the club is fine。Smoke humanity's primary motivations for communicating at all are to have fun and share intimacy。

在夜生活环境中，沟通的乐趣成分是首要的。

It often leads to that intimacy， this is because women with the exception of prostitutes and gold digggers。

I't have sex for logical reason。🎼They tend to have sex for emotional reasons。

Laughter in general fun are among the most relevant positive emotions a woman feels。

People want to be around others who are emotionally relevant。The more emotionally relevant you are.

 The more she will want to be around you。 The more she will follow your lead。

And the more likely she will be to have sex with you then later say， it felt so natural。

 it just happened。Then it's easy for you to see her again if you choose to。

## 幽默和情感共鸣

Random tip about humor and attribution。When you make someone laugh once。

 it's like you told a funny joke。When you make them laugh repeatedly， they think you're a funny guy。

As an adult human， no one is responsible for your emotional state except you。

You should be able to generate your own good emotions and share them with the woman。

Failure to do so makes you irrelevant。Or even a spoiler of other people's fun。

It's like a beggar interrupting， do not be going around the world with a beggar's cup leaching energy off others。

Don't look for them to feel your emotional void。Instead， be the source of good emotions to others。

 and you'll be readily welcomed wherever you go。

## 幽默的应用

Pchematic application of dis commandment。

To have the best time interacting with others， the sure health to be a source of good emotions in their life。

Expling the sense of humor。Andfin work after making pick up the pie。

This will be essential to your short term success。And even your long term ability to go socialize and meet new people at all。

## 避免自我中心

When you go to the club， instead of just feeling like the time flew by.

 and now there's a beautiful woman in your pet。You mightight feel exhausted from forcing yourself to do things。

🎼The Ben。Or even a humiliating。Nobody knows better than I do about humiliation on the club the first 18 months I was coin out。

 we were doing all the crazy shit with that was in that old book The Game。We had hours and hours， 30。

 40 hours of canned routines， tanned remarks。The thing that worked well about this is， well。

 we were knocking on more doors when we're talking to more girls。Biging in more leads。

And that led to more that。However， after you're using all these canned routines and contrived stories you get women in our bed。

It became very apparent and very quickly that spending time with these women were just not satisfying。

Evenn weren hanging out with me because I was me。They were hanging out with me because of the caricature I was presented。

And to a movie， maybe that sounds good。Oh wow， well at least I'm getting more sex。

 at least there's a cute girl in my bed。Yeah that's fine Matt。

 you're not going to get the best women in behavioraving that way you're okay women are willing to settle for okay guys because you're generating good emotions in the short term。

 those emotions aren't sustainable and you're not going to end up hating those girlss in the long term。

Bers who I seen who is best at this in the world。And popular riot movementprint。

HeNever had a girl spend for more than two or three weeks at a time。You could pick up new girls。

 some of them were pretty cute， some of them were pretty mediocre honestly。

 however after the girl hung out with him for a short period of time。

 youd never see them around again， two or three days at most。

Gomen don't like to feel like they've been tricked or manipulated into something。

They want to be with a man who acts like a man all the time。

 they want to be with someone knows who he is， who knows what he wants， who's a strong leader。

creates compelling adventuretures but you can just have a lot of fun and be yourself selfish。

I entirely gave up that routine bass game。Because I only wanted to be with women wanted me for me。

These are the only type of relationships that are going to be long term sustainable。

We immensely fulfilling over any real period of time。If you need short term sex， go by a prostitute。

 I guess， man。If you want quality relationships， there's no better way than this。

## 保持真实

In the area of fun in the club， your ego is not your friend。

 your ego wants to protect your little self image from being rough up a bit.

 your ego may be the major roadblock to your actual success if you allow it。

Don't let your short term you go at emotionss， keep you from accomplishing your long term goal。

You have no control over the perceptions of some other human's mind。Very little control at that。

Again， don't worry about being an excellent manipulator， worry about being an excellent man。

 then scream through the muck and find the woman that's right for you。But for now back to your ego。

When you're rewarding yourself for taking action。

That you know will lead to the long term accomplishment of your goals。

You're on the right trip and you're building self esteing。

You're engaging in a behavior that's going to lead。

Some of the best outcomes available to any man on earth。Despite knowing who you are。

 knowing what you want， and then taking an action towards it。

What's you well above the top 1% of men I hurt？

You're in the top 1% of men。

Don't settle for a mediocre woman， find one that'll be amazing for you。And look the best women。

Just get in front of them， keep your mind。

Let let themselves you because type of woman。

You should want to be。

## 保持积极情绪

B's way to have fun in the back chest。

Simply talk about the things that you think are fun or funny。

Get her mirror neuron response operating in York favorver， in not technical terms。

Neuron neurouron response simply means。

🎼IfYou are having sincere fun in the presence of others。

 their emotional state will tend to drift to be closer to yours。

People are easily convinced to join the fun of others。

Thus， your sincere happiness。

 light heartedness， et cetera literally becomes the catalyst for others around you to start feeling the same way。

🎼Again， this is a primary precursor to intimate behavior。

 Have fun。

Build a connection to legitimize the experience。

 lead the girl。

And sex is a natural thing that happens。

Morere on this topic in my exclusive 10 Commandments of game interview with Tyler。

If you can maintain your sincerely good emotions longer than she can be suspect that you might be some beggar or creep。

 she will often choose to follow your emotional lead and become happy to spend time with you。

For one of by early proteges and game， this was exactly his strongest attribute。

You would basically just get in front of a pretty girl。

And to over share about how awesome he is。

Until she either walked away from disinterest and to confusion。

Work got excited about him and started to overshare about her own life as well。

 Then he would lead the girl， have a couple drinks and take her home。

Get this all the time。

## 文化差异

A cultural note， be aware that a lot of humor， a lot of things that inspire laughter in others。

Perpeicated on harsh truths about the human condition。

Not some fairy tail shit。

Sometimes these are the kind of truths that would make someone want to laugh or cry。

 depending how close this topic was to their personal experience in life。

It's not my goal。

 nor could it be yours to meet people try it for your own amusement。

That's just call being a po man。

However， don't filter your sincere sense of humor around strangers。

Just like not everyone is going to share your goals and values。

 but everyone is going to have fun the same way you do or share your sense of humor。

Be a fixed end adult when someone touches in a sensitive area in your life。

Pive by example on this metric。

There shouldn't be anything a stranger could say to you that would make you cry。

This isn't an outlandish standard to hold other humans to as well。

Do you really want to be spending time around people who are that sensitive or emotional？

Send them back to their facepae for cry and color together with the other adult infants。

Then get back on track。

In example， I really enjoy a lot of irreverence to political correctness and trash humor。

I've enjoyed this juvenile sense of humor well since I was a juvenile。

Occasionally。

 someone is sincerely offended by it。

I don't mind at all when this happened。

Just let me know they're not someone I should be spending my time with。

You don't value your time。

 you don't value your life。

I often delight in making fun of others in the environment。

Again。

Many are excited to indulge a few aren't。

But political correctness is the opposite of true self expression.

 and although it might serve a purpose in corporate culture。

You should leave it there and communicate to the core of a human's emotions。

No one takes action without sufficient physical or emotional arousal。

Boring them to death is not an effective strategy。

While weigh them with your ade expectlessness of political correctness isn't going to do shit except bore someone to doubt.

 it's not going to make them fuck you。

I often think of the show Game of Thrones as a fine guiding light of what people are actually emotionally responsive to。

Every episode contains a new warrant justice， a violation of social norms for some form of atrocity。

It's also the most watched TV show ever created。

Incest， de， torture and genocide。

 that's emotional relevant。

And you can have a lighthearted and fun time getting into the core of the most brutal or taboo topics of the human condition。

How you've got people's attention。

When my friends and I go up together we're so damn curefree and laugh so hard。

 oftentimes men and women in the environment start looking at us。

Some of them are jealous。

 some of them are annoyed， yet irreverence towards the judgment of others combined with our heightened positive emotions is a special sauce that lets others in the environment know you have abundance in their high value people。

Pres through inec people would never be able to tolerate this much of social pressure while still being in the moment without being extremely drunk。

When they see we're sober， or at least relatively sober， we're having so much fun。

 it just can naturally attractive。

Haators will look at you funny and perhaps touch you negatively。

 but there's no more sincere indicator to others that your life is in better order than theirs that they should wish to know you。

Realize the second most common reason in humans laugh or a smile is a deferment of social status。

Yeah， I know you think to yourself，Drek， now you're getting buried of the way。

Forget this man。

 the most common example of this is like an employee laughing at his boss's choke。

 even though the shit wasn't that funny in an nightclub situation。

 this conveyance to status is well as exemplified and a woman tells you a joke that you don't think it's funny。

Instead of laughing instead of engaging a social department and releasing the tension。

Just look they' in the eye and hold that eye contact instead of glass。

Put the circle factor on her to laugh instead。

In a way that she knows that you didn't get the punch line。

 you don't think her shit was funny。

That little sense of her being judged by。

 really spikes her emotions， really captures her attention。

Be cautious with this however。

 if done well， I'll feel a bit conscientious and defer to you to keep your attention。

When done in the wrong context， you just look autistic。

Passing shit tests is another great time to implement this strategy of saying nothing。

Just holding eye contact， maybe raising an eyebrow a bit。

 basically looking at her as if she said something to you。

 that was so disjointed from your reality or her worldview that you found it entirely bizarre and unrelatable as if she ask you if you've ever had sex with a squid passing these so-called shit tests or congruence test。

 by the way， it's oftentimes a great spot to interject humor in the interaction and really amp up her attraction for you。

When she jokingly pushes an identity upon you， the most wouldn't find attractive or flattering。

 this is a fantastic time to simply agree with her。

 and then escalate whatever she' said and make it even more preposterous。

This is based on an improv principle of yes and。

In the art of improv。

 people don't argue with each other， you don't contradict your partner on stage。

Whatever they say to you， or' just like， yes and furthermore。

Yes， Anne。

 you accept what ever has been said is just a given fact。

Then you escalate it or morph it into something else。

In the context of a girl busting your balls in the club， she insinuates that you have a small cock。

 just agree and exaggerate the smallness of it。

Color， it's about the size of your thumb。

KNo。

 about the size of her thumb。

Klllor about a study you read recently about small penises by nationality。

Kelly were shocked to find out about the extent of your physical inadequacy in this area after two years of therapy。

 your counselor told you you'd feel better off instead of thinking about it，As an inch and a half。

 you instead round it off and thought to yourself nearly two inches， nearly two inches。

 then just change the subject。

You don't want to have like a 15 minute conversation about how small your dick is good。

Just accept whatever she said， descalate it further and make it more preposterous。

 have a chuckle together， change the subject。

Another point。

Make sure you're not just being some entertainer showed in the club。

I been doing own fun and getting her emotionally excited to join。

This very different concept in entertaining her like a fucking clown or a court jer。

Do it's fun for you and don't give a damn about her reaction or immediate feedback。

When you're ping off her for feedback， you're no longer having your own funds。

 youve crossed into the realm of seeking validation。

Only feedback you need from the girl is。

 is she still standing in there or is she gone away？

She's still there。

 she's still un't minded about moving things forward to hear the right kind of demand for her。

She just needs some more information to see if it makes sense for her life。

Don't overcomplicate this commandment， just generate your own fund in the general presence of Hckman。

Pull them into whatever you and your friends you're joining and invite her along for the adventure。

She doesn't opt out along the way。

The adventure leaves to your bedroom。

Here's a fun story that happened with one of my buddies and I were out。

My friend and I were in a big city nightclub and saw a couple of really pretty girls standing near a bar.

 so we came over and chatted up the girls。

You're just cling around and talking the lot of shit。

 really got excited about us quickly。

So here's the four of us。

Just fucking off。

 laughing about nothing， have no idea what the hell we were talking about if we're just having a great time。

 just a lot of self expression。

A lot of non judgment and
