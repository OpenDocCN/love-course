# 《神圣女性能量量子新生》：5_33-MMA3丰盛量子沟通

Hello, everyone! 😊 Welcome to today's class on "Quantum Communication for Abundance." In this lesson, we will continue our exploration of the miraculous and the quantum field, and we will focus on establishing an abundance consciousness and manifesting from a feminine energy perspective.

## 1. 回顾前两节课

In the first class, we discussed the source, which is infinite and abundant. God will never run out, and He can afford for everyone to live their best life. The material world we see is just a fraction of the potential that exists in the source. In the second class, we explored why many people still live in scarcity despite the abundance of the source. The reason is that scarcity arises from self-resistance. The only way to manifest abundance is to live in the present moment, as you cannot manifest in the past or future.

## 2. 与本源沟通的方式

Today's class will delve deeper into how we can communicate with the source, the quantum field, or God. Many people ask me how to maintain a high energy state when it fluctuates depending on the progress of their goals. The most important lesson I have learned is to stop arguing with God or life. No matter your current situation, it is exactly where you need to be at this moment. This does not mean you cannot have desires or goals, but rather that you need to accept your current position as a necessary step towards your goals.

## 3. 接受生活现状

Many people make the mistake of confusing their life situation with themselves. Your life situation is just a surface-level aspect of your existence. It is the result of contracts you signed before coming to Earth or the experiences you have created in the 3D world. As you become more aware, you will realize that you are the creator of your life situations from a higher dimension.

## 4. 清晰的欲望和积极的振动

To manifest abundance, you need to have a clear desire and maintain a high vibration. Your thoughts and feelings create your electromagnetic field, so it is crucial to align your thoughts and body sensations with your intention. Here are some key points to keep in mind:

* **Clear desire**: Know exactly what you want to manifest.
* **High vibration**: Maintain a positive and grateful state of mind.
* **Clean thoughts**: Avoid negative thoughts and self-destructive behaviors.
* **Present moment**: Focus on the now and create in the present moment.

## 5. 积极的心态和感恩

Maintaining a positive mindset and practicing gratitude are essential for abundance. Negative thoughts and emotions create resistance and hinder your manifestation process. As you become more aware and practice self-care, you will naturally attract abundance into your life.

## 6. 冥想练习

To help you connect with the quantum field and maintain a high vibration, we will do a meditation exercise on abundance. This exercise will help you feel the abundance that already exists within you and connect with the universal energy.

## 总结

In this lesson, we explored the concept of quantum communication for abundance. We discussed the importance of living in the present moment, accepting your life situation, and maintaining a positive mindset. We also emphasized the significance of clear desires, high vibration, and gratitude. By practicing these principles, you can create an abundant life for yourself.

**Remember, abundance is not just about having more money or material possessions. It is about feeling fulfilled, happy, and connected to the universe.**
