# 社交光谱《蓝图解码2.0重铸蓝图》初级班：07. 跳出大脑：沟通自动化 🧠➡️🎤

在本节课中，我们将学习如何通过全身心投入和语言融合，来提升演讲与沟通的表达力与感染力。核心在于跳出大脑的理性控制，让语言和情绪自然流露。

## 概述：沟通的基石

上一节我们介绍了沟通的基本框架，本节中我们来看看如何为其注入生命力。强者的世界里没有焦虑。人生如戏，我们都是台上的演员，时刻在用言行表达并影响他人。现在，让我们开始蓝图解码之旅。

So you remember I said earlier, sharp as attack? And then that gets that initial hook from there.

最尖锐的**攻击性语言**能吸引听众的初始注意力。

we can add in variation in cadence and tone.

但接下来，我们需要在**节奏**和**语调**上增加变化。

We're going to keep building these one after another after another after another, and it's really like maybe 10 things in speaking that if you just kind of lay it in brick by brick and then you integrate all of them, you're going to have it, you'll literally have it.

我们要像砌砖一样，逐一掌握大约十项说话技巧，并将它们整合起来，最终你就能完全掌握。

It's just different tools you can play with that I played with over time right we're going to hit into projection. We're going to hit into tone use, We're going hit into giving energy into it.

这些是可以随时间练习的不同工具。我们将涉及**声音投射**、**语调运用**以及**注入能量**。

## 注入能量：让沟通带电 ⚡

So the next one I want to show you and this is huge. Is how to bring electricity into the way that you're communicating if you want to do a video, if you want to meet somebody whatever it is, and this is not what I do all the time, but I want you to think of it like yin and yang.

接下来我要展示一个非常重要的技巧：如何为你沟通的方式“注入电流”。无论是录视频还是与人见面，这并非时刻使用，但你可以将其理解为阴阳平衡。

Now, by the way, as you're seeing the way that I'm communicating now, are you noticing the variation in tone in projection, in cadence, in rhythm, Are we seeing that?

现在，请注意我当前的沟通方式。你是否注意到了在**语调**、**投射**、**节奏**和**韵律**上的变化？

### 练习的必经阶段

Okay, so when you're first doing it, you're gonna be try hard with it. You're gonna be like kind of like your bambi baby deer legs with it. You're gonna be confused with it, right kind of you know, so you'll be like, hi yeah, I am oh you know, it's not gonna be natural right away. you get it over time. It's like playing an instrument.

刚开始练习时，你会显得很刻意、笨拙，甚至困惑。比如，你的表达会很不自然。这需要时间，就像学习乐器一样。

### 动态变化的艺术

So as I'm speaking. I can put emphasis. I can put emphasis. I don't just need to go louder and more crazy. I can go quiet. Make you feel like I'm telling you secret. What's the secret? What's the thing no one knows? Why, am I so relaxed, I'm talking right now. Do I know some of you don't? Where I can get all crazy right you know, there's so many different ways that I can do it to switch it up so you can make it like a television show.

当我说话时，我可以强调。我不需要总是更大声或更疯狂。我可以**变安静**，让你感觉我在告诉你一个秘密。秘密是什么？无人知晓的事情是什么？为什么我现在如此放松？我也可以变得疯狂。有太多不同的方式可以切换，让你的表达像一档电视节目。

A great public speaker doesn't need to put a lot of music or graphics into their videos or speaking. If you look at big corporations, they're usually not gonna to have a world class speaker to do their videos So they're gonna to put a little drum roll behind it righty it's owe it. You know, graphic comes on oh and from this. You know, write some flashy images and they're doing that to actually to add stimulation to it, but a great speaker doesn't require that like a truly great rapper could rap acapella where there's no beat right an amazing rapper could freestyle and you just be going crazy even if just some guy was just doing like you know just like a bit of drums like that and like literally you could be like you know and a rapper could just be going and people be going crazy versus if you're not a great rapper you need to have a great beat so I want to get it where you've got an incredible flow so the next step in this.

伟大的演讲者不需要在视频或演讲中加入大量音乐或图形。看看大公司，他们通常没有世界级演讲者来做视频，所以会在背后加点鼓点或炫酷图像来增加刺激。但伟大的演讲者不需要这些，就像顶级的说唱歌手可以无伴奏（Acapella）说唱，即使只有简单的鼓点，也能让人疯狂。相反，如果你不是优秀的说唱歌手，就需要一个很棒的节拍。因此，我们的目标是让你拥有**惊人的流畅度**。

## 核心技巧：与语言融合 🧘➡️💬

Is I want to show you how to add electricity into what you're saying. and this is a combination of a basic level meditation practice and then merging that into speaking.

接下来，我想展示如何为你所说的话注入电流。这结合了基础的冥想练习，并将其融入说话中。

So. I want you to say with me right now, first thing I want you to do is clear your mind, take a nice, deep breath. Notice my kid is there a nice, deep breath. Okay.

现在，请跟着我做。首先，**清空你的思绪**，做一个**深长的呼吸**。注意我的引导，做一个深长的呼吸。好的。

### 保持注意力：像电视节目一样

I'm gonna hold your attention here for days. It's like a TV show. The image keeps changing. You know, TV it changes the images every, every 7 seconds or whatever it is to keep you getting dopamine, right, I'm gonna keep changing it. You're not going to know what to expect, and because of that, you can be half dumb. And yet you'll be like, wow, when I'm learning from this teacher, I feel smart. I can pay attention for hours.

我能长时间吸引你的注意力，就像电视节目。画面不断变化，电视大约每7秒切换画面以让你持续获得多巴胺。我会不断变化，让你无法预测。正因如此，你甚至可以有点“呆”，但你会觉得：“哇，跟这位老师学习，我感觉自己变聪明了。我能集中注意力好几个小时。”

### 注入能量的方法

Okay, we can keep switching it up. And you don't want to make it incongruent, you want to feed energy and electricity into it, so what you do to feed energy into it is go present. take a deep breath and clear your mind because I'm not thinking what I'm speaking, by the way, I'll show you how to do that soon clear your mind Now just say this with me.

我们可以不断切换。你不想让它不协调，你想为它注入能量和电流。为此，你需要**进入当下**：深呼吸，清空思绪（因为我不是在思考我要说的话，稍后我会展示如何做到）。现在，清空思绪，跟着我说。

I want you to put your full awareness, like a meditation practice that's active and active meditation into the word you're saying. So I'm going to say, merge into the word. And as you do it. I want you to imagine like your, hooking up and you're about to climax. Okay, you're hooking up. You're about to climax, when you climax, you're like, like this.

我希望你将全部意识，像一种主动的冥想练习一样，投入到你正在说的词语中。所以我要说：**与词语融合**。当你这样做时，想象你正在亲密接触并即将达到高潮。好的，你在亲密接触，即将高潮，当你高潮时，你是这样的。

## 跳出大脑的负担 🧠➡️🚪

Why do so many people. Have a need to get off. It's because they don't know how to get out of their heads. And of you feel that way where like the major reason that you're attracted to intimacy is because you don't know how to escape your mind. It's one of the few ways that you can actually escape the heaviness of your mind.

为什么那么多人有释放的需求？因为他们不知道如何跳出自己的大脑。如果你有这种感觉，你对亲密感着迷的主要原因是你不知道如何逃离自己的思维。这是少数几种能真正逃离思维沉重感的方式之一。

So a lot of the time, they'll say, oh, that person just, you know, wants to hook up, they're a pervert. I think a lot of people that have a high drive to hook up, they're burdened by the mind. And one of the few one of the few escapes from that is the repetitive motion of intimacy. Okay, the repetitive motion of intimacy. What you have is a situation where, You're not able to get out of your head and you can't get out of your head except in things that you're trained to use to get out of your head.

很多时候，人们会说：“哦，那个人只是想约，是个变态。” 我认为很多有强烈约驱动的人，其实是被思维所累。而少数几种逃离方式之一，就是亲密行为中的**重复性动作**。你所处的状况是：你无法跳出大脑，除了那些你被训练用来跳出大脑的事情。

### 自我训练与出神状态

So if you self stimulate. You don't however you're doing it. Gurable I don't know what you're using right when you're self stimulating what you're doing is you trained yourself to go into almost a hypnotic trance and that trance is happening from the repetition Okay, that's why intimacy in out in out in out sound right I can't go too crazy because we don't want to get in trouble, but you see my main point, right? It's okay if I'm making you aroused guys, even though my guy, it's okay. Okay, you see what you're doing there right, It's arousal. it's self-arousal. You can self-arouse or have a partner in arousal. What are the common elements there. Number one, you're trained to get out of your head when you do that.

所以，如果你自我刺激，无论用什么方式……当你自我刺激时，你所做的是训练自己进入一种近乎催眠的出神状态，这种状态源于**重复**。这就是为什么亲密行为中的“进进出出”……我不能说得太露骨。但你明白我的主要观点，对吧？如果我让你们感到兴奋，没关系。好的，你明白你在做什么吗？那是兴奋，是自我兴奋。你可以自我兴奋或与伴侣一起兴奋。其中的共同要素是什么？第一，你被训练在做那件事时跳出大脑。

See in intimacy, it would be weird to be in your head. you'd be acting weird So you're trained not to be weird and act like that. So it's actually a socially condoned place to get out of the heaviness of the mind right we wouldn't think that in speaking, or maybe in socializing, we wouldn't think, oh, that's a normal place to let go of the burden of the mind. But to be a world class speaker or marketer or communicator or somebody with social skills, you've got to let go of the burden of the mind. That's part of what makes it so attractive is that it then gets other people out of the burden of their mind.

在亲密行为中，如果你还在想东想西，会很奇怪，你的行为也会很奇怪。所以你被训练不要奇怪，要像那样行动。因此，这实际上是一个社会认可的、可以摆脱思维沉重感的地方。我们不会认为在演讲或社交中，“哦，那是一个放下思维负担的正常地方”。但要成为世界级的演讲者、营销人员、沟通者或拥有社交技能的人，你必须**放下思维的负担**。这之所以有吸引力，部分原因在于它也能让他人摆脱他们思维的负担。

If you watch a great speaker, it should it might create intensity, joy, irreverence, but but it also creates lightness. it actually a great speaker, you watch them after you're done watching them a lot of the heaviness of your problems. Goes way, it offers perspective, it gives you altitude on the bigger picture.

如果你观看一位伟大的演讲者，他可能会创造紧张、喜悦、不敬，但同时也创造**轻松感**。实际上，看完一位伟大演讲者后，你问题的许多沉重感会消失，他提供了视角，让你在更大的图景上获得高度。

## 实践方法：先行一步与融合

Well, the way that you do that when you're speaking is that you've got to do what's called go first. say that word go first, go first, so you put yourself in that perspective of the bigger picture letting go. Everything's unfolding exactly as it should in that kind of mode.

那么，你在说话时做到这一点的方法是：你必须**先行一步**。说“先行一步”，这样你就把自己置于那种放下、从更大图景看问题的视角中。在这种模式下，一切都在按其应有的方式展开。

and so didn't quite hit the note there, but I can't close, so you see the point is that you've got to get yourself in that mode. And so you have to merge into the word. Okay, it's like you're being physically intimate with the word, you're making love. To the word, okay and. The only place to make love in life is not just like. Right That's not the only place you can do the same thing. With your speaking. The same thing, you can be hitting a certain cadence. And as you're hitting that cadence, people are going into trance and you can be playful, just like you could in intimacy, right, you can do a little takeaway, right in intimacy, you can do a little takeaway or you can add energy, you can get crazy. You can get raw. In more ways than one, you could be wrong And okay, ' more than one way. And see, But look how can you ship. There's more than one way, right, we can dial it back. You see the playful. You can be playful, unexpected in the moment and adding energy to it. play with it. Play with it. Feed into it, merge into the word.

所以，关键是你必须让自己进入那种模式。因此，你必须**与词语融合**。好的，就像你与词语进行身体上的亲密接触，你在与词语**做爱**。生命中做爱的地方不仅仅是……对吧？那不是唯一能做同样事情的地方。在你的演讲中也可以做同样的事情。你可以敲击某种节奏，当你敲击那个节奏时，人们会进入出神状态，你可以很顽皮，就像在亲密行为中一样。你可以稍微抽离，在亲密行为中，你可以稍微抽离，或者你可以增加能量，可以变得疯狂，可以变得原始。方式不止一种。你看，但你怎么能做到呢？方式不止一种，我们可以收回来。你看到了那种顽皮。你可以在当下变得顽皮、出人意料，并为之增加能量。玩弄它。与它互动，**融入词语**。

### 练习：融入词语

Okay, sometimes with stretching this can help us. So try saying the word merge into the word, Say to me merge. word So okay, join the word. Integrates. With your sentence, merge into your speaking.

好的，有时通过延伸练习会有所帮助。试着说“与词语融合”这个词。对我说：融合。词语。好的，加入词语。整合。与你的句子，**融入你的演讲**。

## 总结与下节预告

本节课我们一起学习了沟通自动化的核心。最尖锐的攻击性语言能吸引初始注意力，但需在节奏和语调上增加变化。我们要学会在语言中注入能量，体现在语调、声音投射及节奏韵律的变化上。就像顶级说唱歌手无需伴奏也能即兴，出色的表达者也能通过语言本身制造震撼效果。优秀的表达者可以在不同语气和情绪间自由切换，这需要时间和练习，初期可能会不自然。

下一节课将是实操环节的欣赏：泰勒现场对学员的操练。请你一起跟随氛围和感受，沉浸于现场之中。相信你将学到许多关于突破焦虑及脱离完美主义折磨的方法。视频最后我会与大家欣赏并解读。
